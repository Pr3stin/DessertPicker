DessertPicker is a code challenge that takes 2 API endpoints and fetches the data from them.

When you first load the app, you will be brought to the Dessert screen which is a list of desserts (in alphabetical order) fetched from the API.

You can scroll through the desserts and press on any name you'd like to know more about.

When you choose your desired dessert, a new view will appear with the title of the desert, the list of ingredients and their required measurements, as well as the 
instructions on how to make the dessert. All of this information is provided from another API fetch.

In the top left corner of the screen is a button that when pressed, takes you back to the list of desserts.

Thank you and enjoy your desserts!
